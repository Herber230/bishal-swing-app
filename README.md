## Contribution

### How to Contribute

This project is open for contributions. The management of the project is done through GitHub, so the contributors must have a GitHub account. The main contributors are the students of the academy, but anyone can contribute to the project.

The contribution strategy is trunk-based development, so the contributors must create a branch from the `main` branch, make the changes, and then create a pull request to merge the changes back to the `main` branch. This will trigger a workflow called `pull-request-check` through GitHub Actions, that will run the tests and the linters to ensure the quality of the code. Then some of the contributors will review the changes and approve the pull request. Once the pull request is approved, it can be merged to the `main` branch and the branch must be deleted.
